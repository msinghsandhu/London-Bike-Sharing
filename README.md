# London Bike Sharing Using Python

## Problem Statement:
The London bike sharing dataset presents a rich source of information regarding bike rental patterns within the city. However, there exist several challenges and opportunities within this dataset that necessitate further exploration and analysis. One significant problem to address is the optimization of bike sharing services to improve operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. This involves understanding the factors influencing bike rental demand, such as weather conditions, time of day, day of the week, and special events. Additionally, there is a need to identify potential bottlenecks in bike availability and distribution across docking stations, particularly during peak hours and high-demand periods. By addressing these challenges, stakeholders can enhance the overall performance and accessibility of bike sharing systems in London, leading to a more sustainable and convenient transportation option for residents and visitors alike.

## Solution Approach:

To address the problem statement, the following approach was used:

### * Data Import: 
  The dataset was provided by Kaggle in CSV format.

### * Data Modeling and Relationship Creation: 
   Data modeling was performed within Power BI to create relationships between the relevant tables in the dataset. This step ensured that the data could be properly analyzed and visualized.

### * Data Cleaning and Transformation: 
Power BI's data transformation features, such as Power Query, were utilized to clean and transform the data. Irrelevant entries, duplicates, and inconsistencies were removed or resolved, ensuring the data was accurate and reliable.

### * Dashboard Creation - Key Insights: 
The first type of dashboard, "Key Insights," was created to provide an overview of the bike sharing trend along with 2 Weeks simple moving average. This dashboard focused on presenting high-level metrics, such as total bike sharing, 2 Weeks simple moving average, sharing by season, and share by time period. Visualizations like charts, graphs, and KPIs were used to convey the key insights effectively.

The dashboard was designed to be interactive, allowing users to filter and drill down into specific dimensions or time periods of interest.

## Expected Outcome:
By implementing the above solution approach, AtliQ hardware expects to achieve the following outcomes:

   * Enhanced Data Analysis: Utilizing Power BI facilitates real-time or near-real-time analysis of bike share trends, enhancing the efficiency of data exploration and interpretation. This advanced analytics solution empowers users to delve deeper into the dataset, enabling more thorough insights and comprehension.

   * Improved Decision Making: The implementation of the Key Insights dashboard provides users with a holistic perspective of bike sharing trends, fostering informed decision-making processes. By discerning patterns across various dimensions, such as peak usage times and customer behaviors, stakeholders can optimize operational strategies, refine maintenance schedules, and target specific market segments with precision.

   * Increased Efficiency: Leveraging Power BI's robust data transformation capabilities streamlines tasks related to data cleaning and manipulation. This efficiency gain allows users to dedicate more time to analyzing data and extracting actionable insights, ultimately enhancing productivity and effectiveness in decision-making processes.

   * Revenue Growth: By harnessing the insights derived from Power BI dashboards, bike sharing companies anticipate a projected growth of at least 15% in the upcoming quarter in terms of bike share usage. The data-driven approach facilitated by Power BI enables the identification of growth opportunities and the implementation of strategic initiatives aimed at maximizing revenue and market penetration.
     
This solution approach harnesses the capabilities of Power BI to deliver a comprehensive data analysis and visualization solution, empowering stakeholders to make informed decisions and mitigate instances of bike unavailability effectively.
